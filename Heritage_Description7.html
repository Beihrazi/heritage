                            <p>All Saints Church is constructed on the Kacheri Road in Shillong. One among the oldest churches in the city, this was built during the British Raj and boasts of colonial style architectural finesse. The church was a whole wooden structure and is busiest during the routine Sunday masses.
                                <br>
                                Situated opposite the State Central Library and quite close to the Police Bazaar, it is very convenient to reach the All Saints Church through any means of local transportation. </p>

                        <h2>history</h2>
                        <p>The church’s foundation stone was laid by Lord Northbrook, the Viceroy of India from 1872–76, during his visit to Shillong on August 22nd 1874. The construction of the church was completed in 1877 and on August 18th of the same year, Bishop Edward Johnson of Calcutta consecrated the church and dedicated it to “All Saints”. The church’s original stone building on Kacheri Road was sadly devastated in the great earthquake of 1897 and a new building was completed in 1902. It was designed and supervised by Mr W. Arundel, an engineer and architect in the Assam–Bengal Railways. It was built in Tudor style, comprising mostly wood brought from Myanmar, and tinted glasses shipped all the way from England. The wood construction was done keeping in mind Shillong’s location in an earthquake-prone zone.</p>
