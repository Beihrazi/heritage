                        <p>Once a year inside this site a festival (Monolith festival) is organized to show how various Khasi tribes once lived. This place was created in the likeness of various Khasi villages. An amphitheater can be observed where projections take place and a museum containing artifacts, tools, weapons, everyday and occasional objects widely used by the Khasi. There is also a section dedicated to archery. Right now the site looks more a reminder of a lost civilization.</p>
