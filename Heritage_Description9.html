                        <p>This historical monument was built in the centre of a vast field known as Madiah Kmai Blai, which is on the banks of Syntu Ksiar, alongside river Myntdu. This field also has its own historical significance, as it is the place where U Kiang Nongbah had taken his oath to fight and drive the British out of their land without fearing any consequences.On the banks of the Myntduriver in the SyntuKsiar Valley on a field known as 'Madiah Kmal Blai' stands a monument dedicated to Kiang Nangbah. Kiang Nangbah was a Jaintia patriot during the British rule and died as a martyr for the cause of Indian liberation from British rule.</p>
