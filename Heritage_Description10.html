                            <p>The bridge is located in the district of Jaintia hills. It is situated between Jowai and Jarain. The bridge is built over the Um-Nyakanah river. Strong stone pillars very well support the bridge. According to the local people, the bridge was constructed by Jaintia kings who ruled these lands during the medieval period.

                        <p>The bridge took over a time of 100s of years to span. Jaintia kings built the bridges for promoting trade and use as a means of communication and for the armies. This historical bridge is under the Archaeological Survey of Indiaâ€™s protection.<br>

The main aim of the festival is to re-unite all the 53 Himas of the Khasis through a popular platform of cultural display and simultaneously creates a medium through which the tourist populace can learn more about the rich Khasi art and culture.</p>
